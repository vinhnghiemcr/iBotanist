iBotanist

“iBotanist” is an intelligent plant-care system that gives your house plants the caring they deserve even when you are far away from home. The all-in-one system will not only keep track of the plant’s conditions at all times, but can also be set up to stay on a consistent watering and light cycle and update the conditions of the plant to a web-based application. Data about the plant's conditions such as the amount of light, temperature, and humidity will be sent to the web application and updated regularly for the plant owner to see. Furthermore, through a friendly user interface, the user will be given control of an automatic watering and lighting system so they can specify the lighting conditions and how much water their plant needs.
